# Stock Analysis (VBA) with Excel
## Overview and Purpose of Project
The intent of this project was to refactor an original code within the VBA coding of Microsoft Excel. In return, I was able to decide if investing in the definitive stock information was worthwhile for my client in the years 2017 and 2018. Originally, the same project was already completed, but resulted in slower coding efficiency. After refactoring the given code, the effciency expelled the same results as a quicker more efficient rate. 
## Results
I included the given refactoring steps listed below, to my original stock analysis VBA coding.
